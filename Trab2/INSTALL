INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

If you are upgrading, also see the instructions in UPGRADING.

1. Untar rnews.tar.gz into a directory published by your web server that runs PHP
   scripts this will create an rnews directory.  Life will be easiest if you preserve
   file permissions, like this:  tar xzpvf rnews-x.xx.tar.gz

2. Go to http://your.site/somedir/rnews/install.php

3. Enter the configuration and follow the instructions.  In particular, see step 4.

4. Remove read permissions from install.php, by one of:
   a) removing install.php altogether
   b) chmod o-rwx install.php
   c) create .htaccess for apache that denies access:
      <Files "install.php">
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
      </Files>

5. Remove write permissions from inc/config_user.php

6. Add a user account and get started!
