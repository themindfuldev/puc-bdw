0.9x to 1.00:
  As below for 0.8x to 0.9x, steps 1-6.


0.8x to 0.9x:

  1. Untar 0.9x into a new folder.
  2. Copy inc/config_user.php from 0.8x to the new folder.  As usual, if you
     modify inc/config.php, you'll have to manually merge it.
  3. If you use cached images, move the old 'img/feeds' (or whatever you have
     configured) into the new installation folder.
  4. Visit the 0.9x install.php.
  5. The DB will be upgraded automatically after confirming the DB settings.
  6. Restore proper permissions on inc/config_user.php and install.php.


0.80 to 0.81:

  No changes needed.


0.72 to 0.80:

  The DB schema has changed in several ways.  The preferred upgrade procedure is:
   - save your feed list by exporting to OPML,
   - install 0.80 using a different database,
   - add your user account, and
   - import your feeds from the OPML file.
   - if all is well, nuke your old database (drop database rnews_db)


0.61 - 0.63 to 0.7:

  if you are upgrading to rnews-0.7 from .61 - .63, you should not have to
  change your database structure manually - rnews will do that for.

  however, if you have trouble, I recommend you nuke the database and start
  from scratch. (make sure to save your subscriptions first!)

  ( drop database rnews_db; create database rnews_db; )
